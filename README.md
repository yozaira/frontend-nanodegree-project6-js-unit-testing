#### Overview

The main goal of this project is to write tests for a web-based <b>Feeds Reader Application</b> as a way to demonstrate the important role that unit testing plays in the development process.

The practice of unit testing (of which TDD is a subset) can greatly improve the quality of developers code, as it forces them to analyze multiple aspects of an application, including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
